Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

PROJECT

Credit Card Fraud Detection
Data Handling: Implemented techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the class imbalance issue, ensuring the model performs well on the minority class (fraudulent transactions).
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score to ensure the model's effectiveness in detecting fraud.
Feature Engineering: Created new features from existing data to improve the model's accuracy, such as transaction time patterns and customer spending behavior.
Model Optimization: Used grid search and cross-validation to tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Deployment: Demonstrated how the model could be integrated into a real-time transaction processing system to flag potential fraud in real-time.

Sales Prediction using Python
Time Series Analysis: Applied time series analysis techniques to understand sales trends, seasonality, and forecasting.
Feature Selection: Identified key features impacting sales, such as promotional activities, holidays, and economic indicators, to include in the predictive model.
Model Comparison: Compared different regression models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to find the best-performing model.
Visualization: Created visualizations to communicate insights from the data, including sales trends, forecast accuracy, and feature importance.
Business Impact: Demonstrated how the sales prediction model could help the business in inventory management, marketing strategy, and financial planning.

Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Collaborative Filtering: Implemented collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user behavior and preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Added content-based filtering by incorporating movie metadata like genre, director, and cast to improve recommendation accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance in predicting ratings.
Data Augmentation: Enhanced the dataset by incorporating additional information from external sources, like user reviews and social media mentions, to refine predictions.
Scalability: Discussed strategies for scaling the movie rating prediction system to handle large volumes of data, ensuring quick and accurate predictions for millions of users.
